1
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:09,026
(wind blowing)

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,333
(uplifting piano music)

3
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,902
- Oh, that's nice.

4
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,235
(uplifting piano music)

5
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:02,888
- We all have demons.

6
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,596
We all have dark days.

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:08,961
I believe we all even have
things we're running from.

8
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,194
I do what I do, because
I've been lucky enough

9
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,254
to identify two disciplines in my life

10
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:15,843
that I absolutely love to do.

11
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:19,090
And, for me, these two things
are my strongest talismans

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,336
against keeping ahead of my demons.

13
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:23,233
When I'm climbing, it's
like force meditation.

14
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,832
I'm in the moment, and then I shoot things

15
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,435
that are fast-paced environments.

16
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,159
You know, a 12-hour day,
freezing my ass off,

17
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,326
and I'm gonna miss that one
shot if I'm not in the zone.

18
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:40,606
Pefect, Audrey.

19
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:41,439
- Alright.

20
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,772
- Amazing, okay.

21
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:46,375
And then, something like
it's definitely flicked

22
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,959
in my head one day when I was climbing,

23
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,843
I realized that there were a lot

24
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,100
of active climbers out there,

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,134
and there were a lot of really
world-class photographers,

26
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:55,773
but there was very few
crossing over those two realms.

27
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,204
Like, really putting in the effort

28
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,764
and shooting with intention.

29
00:01:58,764 --> 00:01:59,884
That was the biggest thing for me.

30
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,046
That was the biggest inspiration for me.

31
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,684
I really felt like there was a gap there,

32
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:07,023
and that I was just
excited to share and film.

33
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:07,964
I'm never more excited

34
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,452
than after I've just finished a route,

35
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:11,505
then when I get home and
I'm uploading all my files,

36
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:15,143
and I get to start editing what
I've captured over that day.

37
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,781
Just inciting that stoke
and that passion in people

38
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,753
is big to me, because
that was incited in me.

39
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:22,710
That was given to me through other people,

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,739
and other creatives in the valley,

41
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,489
and that totally changed my life.

42
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,391
In the beginning it was just like, yeah,

43
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,786
it was just like what
everyone does, right?

44
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:34,919
Little point and shoot camera,
no intention, no effort.

45
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,196
It was a little Olympus Tough.

46
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,881
I was just shooting whatever
compositions I could get

47
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,191
while climbing whatever
I was normally climbing.

48
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,517
- When I first started
getting out with John,

49
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:47,111
his skill level, I would
say, it was pretty minimal,

50
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,679
because he was handling
DSLRs, digital cameras,

51
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,206
for the first time.

52
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:55,206
He was just starting from
scratch, more or less.

53
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,176
(alarm clock blaring)

54
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,481
- The way I've lived this last year

55
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:02,494
stems from my one main goal this year,

56
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:06,702
and that was to be as
available and free as possible

57
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,993
to climb and shoot whenever I needed to,

58
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:11,337
and that meant if a high profile climber

59
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:13,340
wanted me to do something with them,

60
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,476
I'd be able to say yes, drop
of the hat, no matter what.

61
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,455
If the light was perfect
and all conditions aligned,

62
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,364
and you know, light just turning yellow,

63
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:22,821
and fresh snowfall on a castle, whatever.

64
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,340
I wanted to be available this year

65
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,780
to get after any opportunity

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,764
and say yes to every single opportunity,

67
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,521
and that meant work as
absolutely minimal as possible,

68
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,406
which translates to
earning next to no money,

69
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:35,353
and getting out all the time.

70
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:38,186
(uplifting music)

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,679
Then I got really psyched
on sharing the images,

72
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,297
and I noticed people were
responding really well to them,

73
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:01,196
and people like friends back
home in Australia, New Zealand,

74
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,985
Canada, they liked the
words attached to them,

75
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,919
they liked the insight into
the climbing lifestyle,

76
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,303
and you see the hundreds of comments,

77
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,914
people wanting to go and do
that route after you've shot it,

78
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,215
and getting so psyched on climbing again,

79
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:17,037
or being inspired to start
taking their camera out

80
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,279
on the climbs that they're doing.

81
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,829
That, in turn, inspired me to, you know,

82
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,473
well, how can I tell, how can
I share this more accurately,

83
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,121
or in a way to invoke more emotion,

84
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:30,025
or that people can actually
see what's going on.

85
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,858
(uplifting music)

86
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,483
- I think if one didn't know John,

87
00:04:57,483 --> 00:05:01,481
and they just saw his social media image,

88
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,068
they would think he's been
at this for a long time,

89
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,898
and is doing really well with it.

90
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:10,853
- One of the hardest
things with social media

91
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:15,744
is that you feel kind of a
pressure to only report the good.

92
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:17,533
You wanna come back from a day,

93
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,276
and you have this epic image that you love

94
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,169
and that you wanna share,

95
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,133
and you know, you don't to attach,

96
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,258
oh, had a shitty day, I broke my lens.

97
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,242
I feel really down.

98
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,250
Man, I'm so broke.

99
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,458
You wanna post something

100
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,261
about how epic the photo is that you got.

101
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:32,238
You know, this is so rad.

102
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,065
Look at this cool, such a great day.

103
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,903
I can't even remember how many times

104
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,335
my captions on my photos have started with

105
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,252
such a great day or such a fun day.

106
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,586
There's a formula to what's
popular on social media.

107
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,279
People shoot that formula,

108
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,604
and they portray that perfect
life to market themselves.

109
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:55,352
I think it's just really
negative for our mental health,

110
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,500
and for society for
everyone to constantly be

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,897
negatively envious of
other people's lifestyles,

112
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,372
because it's bullshit.

113
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:02,455
You don't see the reality.

114
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:03,359
You don't see their pressure,

115
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,525
and you don't see the bill paying.

116
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,613
You don't see the fights, you
don't see any of that crap.

117
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:10,345
You just see hammocks, and
perfect climbs, and summit days,

118
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,519
and it just kind of feels like a lie.

119
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,639
Like, none of us live perfect lives.

120
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,238
None of us are always happy.

121
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:17,815
None of us always get the
dream jobs or the dream gigs.

122
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,465
I think the reality is social
media just makes us feel down

123
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:23,468
and anxious, and like we're
missing out on something.

124
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,742
- There's a huge discrepancy, I think,

125
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,320
between what it's like to
do photography for work,

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,044
and what the general public thinks it is.

127
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,011
- You put images out there,

128
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,551
and people make up their own mind

129
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,538
about what your life is like,

130
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,050
and sometimes it's really
far from the truth.

131
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,943
- People can play with social media a lot.

132
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,051
There can be a lot of
altered truths out there,

133
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,940
and same with photography.

134
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,655
I think there's,

135
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:51,872
you know, it must be really
hard as a photographer to

136
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:53,884
always have a pure image.

137
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,393
- It's nice if you're able to be honest,

138
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,940
and convey that it's not always just

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,729
everyday is not the best day all the time,

140
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:01,748
but at the same time, yeah,

141
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:04,260
you have to put your best stuff out there.

142
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,536
Even if it's unwillingly,

143
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,788
you're still maybe misleading
people a little bit.

144
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,955
- It's a juggling act of
truth and selling yourself.

145
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,537
There I was shooting everyday,

146
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:21,041
and everyone was under the impression

147
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,169
that I was getting paid for this,

148
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,990
that all my personal creative
projects were paid gigs,

149
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,630
and I was living the dream, and
I was doing what I wanna do,

150
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,796
and hanging out with my friends everyday,

151
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,782
and climbing and shooting,

152
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,707
and the reality is I was making money

153
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:35,861
from like 10% of that stuff.

154
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:36,694
Yeah, after a while,

155
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,632
I just thought of this series of portraits

156
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:42,248
that I could do to kind of
maybe show the reality of this.

157
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,014
It's not paid gigs, and
it's late nights editing,

158
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:47,314
and it's not glamorous.

159
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,770
And so, to do that, my friends,

160
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,549
I was house-sitting for my
friend and sat down with his dog,

161
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:55,071
and staged some portraits
there where I was eating

162
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,374
a pack of ramen for dinner,

163
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:59,217
and she was eating one little dog treat.

164
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:03,296
Yeah, it wasn't far from
the truth for months there.

165
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,916
It was touch and go.

166
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,416
And, I was just...

167
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:10,083
uncomfortable with what
people thought I was,

168
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,821
and thought the life that I lived,

169
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:16,110
and I just wanted to
shed some truth on that.

170
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,595
That was a shot I took of my cousin

171
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:21,345
at a burnt out observatory
back in Australia.

172
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,672
When I shot that photo,

173
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,034
I had all of these themes
running through my head,

174
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:27,639
because the inside of the observatory

175
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,748
was burnt out and concrete,
and stark and rundown,

176
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:35,115
and outside was this beautiful blue sky,

177
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,487
green grass, sunny day,

178
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,161
and it was like a reminder
to friends and to people,

179
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,099
like hey, we all feel shitty.

180
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,364
No one's life is perfect.

181
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,586
I've suffered from depression

182
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:46,212
like a lot of people, I'm sure,

183
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,129
and just...

184
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,574
don't believe in the crap.

185
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:52,094
I don't believe in that myth.

186
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:53,944
That got more hits and more
comments and more feedback

187
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:57,102
than any post I've ever done.

188
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,665
The more I get involved in social media,

189
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:02,282
the more I feel responsible
to break down those barriers

190
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,220
and that facade.

191
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,053
- As an athlete,

192
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,935
I don't wanna be on a picture
that I haven't climbed.

193
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:11,073
I don't wanna have a shot
of me doing something

194
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:12,303
that I haven't done,

195
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,914
or that the rope's taken
out of from above me,

196
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,791
or the gears erased,
or something like that.

197
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,117
I want it to be a real
photo of me doing something

198
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:21,381
that I've achieved,

199
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,881
otherwise I don't want it to be out there.

200
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:24,921
That's something I stand by,

201
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,921
and I feel like John's on the same page

202
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,276
with his photography.

203
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,001
- I think if you can
instill real storytelling,

204
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,395
and honesty in social
media in any way possible

205
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,325
in whatever you do, whatever it is,

206
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,741
if you can find that balance
and have a truly loving,

207
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:43,820
respectful, honest
community following you,

208
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,807
then that to me is, you know,

209
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:49,443
500 of those people are
worth 10 million people

210
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,514
who believe in a myth.

211
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:54,821
Whoa, wow, this looks amazing.

212
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:58,335
- Where is John gonna take it from here?

213
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:02,368
He has the potential to take
it into so many directions.

214
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,921
I'm certainly very much
looking forward to seeing him

215
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,247
just go the same
direction he's been going,

216
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,015
and just document those
wild places we have

217
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:16,320
that very few people ever get
to see, let alone document.

218
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,173
(uplifting piano music)

219
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:24,434
- As for what the future
holds, I don't know.

220
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,267
I don't know,

221
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:29,736
but I'm feeling very
positive about where I'm at,

222
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,346
and where I know I wanna go,

223
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:35,357
and the people that I have around me, and

224
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:39,450
yeah, I'm just gonna keep doing what I do,

225
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,642
keep being me, and see
where the road takes me.

226
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,975
