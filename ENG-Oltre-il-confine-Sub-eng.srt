1
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,480
Веќе некое време

2
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,040
пишувам за планините
и Алпските планинари.

3
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,800
Но има една слика
која постојано ми се навраќа на ум,

4
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,160
 осамен човек, завиткан во ќебе ,
движејќи се низ снего.

5
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,640
Ettore Castiglioni ниту планинареше,

6
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
ниту пак бараше слава.

7
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,086
Тој се враќаше дома, во Италија.

8
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,560
Преку најтешката патека,
во невозможни услови.

9
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Со месеци
немаше никакви вести од него.

10
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,720
Пријателите и роднините
се плашеа од најлошото.

11
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
Германската окупација се засили,

12
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,080
на границата партизаните и 
фашистите, граничарите и бегалците,

13
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,040
криумчарите и шпионите,
сите се движеа во истата долина,

14
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,682
 под истиот врв.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,080
Седумдесет години подоцна,
 смртта на Castiglioni сеуште е мистерија.

16
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Поради тоа отидов и до едно од местата
кои му беа најдраги и го отворив неговиот дневник.

17
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
Којзнае дали одговорот што го барам
 го има помеѓу странициве.

18
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Едно светло и чисто пладне
стигнуваме до Розета.

19
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,295
Навистина восхитувачки пејзаж.

20
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Висорамнината е голема и широка,
единствено ограничена од врвови и сино небо.

21
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,320
Погледнуваме кон Сан Мартино
со светот под нашите стапала.

22
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,840
Колку мал изгледа од оваа далечина.
И како се чувствуваме блиску до рајот.

23
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Ettore, или чичко Nino,

24
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:23,655
бил најмладиот
од браќата Castiglioni

25
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
иако сите
го нарекувале Ettorino, или Nino.

26
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Уживавме посебна врска
бидејќи беше

27
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,000
најмладиот чичко
и различен од останатите.

28
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Исто така, тој се однесуваше поинаку.
Ни даваше внимание без

29
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:56,760
некоја посебна грижа,
секојпат на соодветна дистанца.

30
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:08,960
Чичко Nino имаше тежок карактер.

31
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,360
 Тој беше тивок и осамен.

32
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,600
 Не сакаше да се фали.

33
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,480
Ја сакаше уметноста.

34
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,589
Се сеќавам и на неговата пасија
за музика,

35
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,960
бидејќи ја префрли на мене.

36
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,960
Свиреше на пијано.
Многу гу слушаше Debussy.

37
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:37,720
The Bergamasque Suite беше музиката
којашто најчесто ја изведуваше,

38
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Чуваше многу работи за себе,
 размислуваше,

39
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,680
со чести напади на меланхолија.

40
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,880
 Нешто што најдобро ја опишува длабоката поврзаност

41
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,520
која што тој ја чувстваше со планините и музиката.

42
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:29,577
Чичко Nino почна да оди
во планините

43
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,600
на многу рана возраст 
со Manlio и неговите браќа.

44
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,286
Неговата природна способност 
за надминување на

45
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,320
најтешките услови,
беше видлива веднаш.

46
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,680
Кога Manlio сметаше
дека е соодветно,

47
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
 го именуваше како лидер.

48
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,320
На едвај 14 години,
тоа е навистина неверојатно.

49
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,760
Четири дена одев низ
планините и долините,

50
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,320
низ борови шуми и ливади,
создадени од природата

51
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,160
спиев во штали, пиев вода од поток,
хранејќи се само со малини

52
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,440
и боровинки.

53
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,280
Губејќи се низ шумата 
повторно ја открив убавината на животот.

54
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,320
1930 остави голем белег
на планинарењето.

55
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:13,095
Но какво било
тие години?

56
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,360
Спортската техника била
најважна за потврдата

57
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:24,720
од големите земји,

58
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,280
помеѓу две војни,
и два тоталитарни режими,

59
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,400
од нацистите во Германија
и фашистите во Италија

60
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,120
Во планинарењето, физичките
аспекти, како што е освојување на врв

61
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,440
комбинирано со оние кои што се помалку физички
како храброста.

62
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,640
Двата фактори заедно
го отсликуваат она што го нарекуваме

63
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
„духот на времето".

64
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,760
Долгите и истоштувачки вежби
изведени со ентузијазам од

65
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,240
младите фашисти, под водство
на генералниот секретар

66
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
и придружени од планинарите 
на 44 тата легија на војската,

67
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,360
ја одбележаа силната физичка подготовка
на Bellunese Blackshirts.

68
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,120
Имаше вистинско шоу на хероизам

69
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
во карактерите кои беа
поврзувани со фашизам.

70
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,440
The regime took possession of
mountaineering skills and techniques,

71
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,240
and turned them into vehicles
of political propaganda.

72
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,920
If we begin to talk about heroism,
heroism is pretty much dead.

73
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:53,425
 Italians have become
a load of hypocrites,

74
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,495
in that as soon as any fascist

75
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,520
burns a finger on a match he
is hailed as a hero.

76
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,200
And the same in the mountains, heroism
has become everyday stuff.

77
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
Each rock face is unsurmountable,
every grip treacherous,

78
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,560
any obstacle unsuperable, a single
drop of rain a hurricane!

79
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,840
There are individuals like Castiglioni

80
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,595
 who do not recognize themselves
in the spirit of the time.

81
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,480
There is no show of heroic spirit,

82
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,720
rather a retreatwithin oneself
to a much more private place.

83
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,560
In the diary of his early years,
Castiglioni writes,

84
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,160
 "I would like to nullify myself
 in these parts of the mountain."

85
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,640
There lies death ...

86
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,280
Yes, that is something that bears
thinking about.

87
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,200
 At the time the only acceptable limit
was death. Death is the limit!

88
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,400
 Beyond it, there are no limits.

89
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,640
His special talent was to get
physical with the mountain,

90
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,760
and then conquer the summit.

91
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,880
This style of practice became
 his personal "stamp".

92
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,120
His mountaineering history consists of victories.

93
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:11,160
 He opened up many new routes of interest
at the same time,

94
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,000
challenging to the art of climbing.

95
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,040
He used to say, the ascent,
especially the first time round,

96
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,120
must be conceived of as a work of art,
otherwise, it loses its meaning.

97
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,280
The concept of "elegance" is always
cropping up in Castiglioni's accounts.

98
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,680
He was spurred by a quest for elegance
in his climbing. Would you agree?

99
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,160
I think Castiglioni saw the
climb line as being something beautiful.

100
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,720
And to create something of beauty
on the mountain face,

101
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
you have not to force the issue.

102
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
You have to scout for
and follow a natural line

103
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,720
which is ultimately part
of nature's design.

104
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,080
You trained in the art along lines
 pioneered by Castiglioni.

105
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,120
And 50 years on,
you too opened up new climbs,

106
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:29,830
so you're one of his successors.

107
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:35,640
I learned to climb by following
the example of those

108
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:39,264
who like Castiglioni have
made mountaineering history.

109
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,631
This is his guide to the Brenta Dolomites,

110
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,200
my first purchase when I was 18.

111
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,760
it is a bit worn now.

112
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
I spent my nights reading about the routes.

113
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,760
 I was trying to plan the climb
in my imagination

114
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:03,365
even before going on it.

115
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,000
Another gem that was added to
 the mountaineering campaign this year,

116
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,263
is the study of the mountains.

117
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,160
Collaborating with the CAI/Touring Club
has made me realize that

118
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
my climbing is not just
a case of selfish indulgence

119
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:35,695
but yields practical
and useful results.

120
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,520
Now I can proceed unrestrained,

121
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,563
 improving the guide,
day by day, with new itineraries.

122
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
I believe that Ettore
was looking for adventure.

123
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,640
A desire to explore,
 to visit new places.

124
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,000
Deep down  he was looking
for a great experience to take home.

125
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,280
The satisfaction in having found
the right line,

126
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,600
to have dreamed it up
and drawn it on the rock face.

127
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,425
Here in the guide, you relive it!

128
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,400
When he talks of his climbs you
feel it was something artistic.

129
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
An art form he wanted
to experience on the rock face

130
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:36,135
and leave for the others.

131
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,080
I feel increasingly more the master of
my skills and techniques because it

132
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:07,463
is no longer the urges of struggle and
conquest that push me to the top.

133
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:12,071
I love this rock, and I want to
get to know it by inch by inch.

134
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,240
But it is a knowledge ought to come in steps,
it should not be forced.

135
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,920
Only then will the mountain
reward me with the best foothold.

136
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Today we climb
with high-tech equipment

137
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,360
 which Castiglioni
would have found unimaginable

138
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,920
This equipment has been perfected
by years of testing

139
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,120
and we are certain it works.

140
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,120
But think of what they had to
use, completely different gear,

141
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,560
yet even so, they were able
to achieve great feats.

142
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,240
How important is your partner on the rope?

143
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,000
Your partner on the rope
is everything because you

144
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,960
have to trust them 100%
when you're on the face.

145
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,440
Castiglioni was able to climb
with the big names of his time,

146
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:57,840
like Vinazer, Gino Pisoni, Bruno Detassis,
with whom he achieved great feats

147
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,480
And when he moved
to the Central Alps

148
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,080
he teamed up
with Vitale Bramani

149
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,760
 Both of them came from Milan
 and were long-standing friends.

150
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,280
Together they conquered the
northern face of Pizzo Badile.

151
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,400
On that occasion, Vitale came up
with an improvement of the equipment.

152
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,800
He had the idea of replacing
the metal nails

153
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,160
 they used to have under the soles,

154
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:48,200
 with rubber ones that
promised more grip on the rock.

155
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,560
It's a technological innovation
still in use today,

156
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,240
because we have
Vibram soles on our feet when we climb.

157
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
The concept has remained
the same.

158
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I believe that Castiglioni's
special ability was

159
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,640
to have the ideas and
then be able to pull them off,

160
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,760
 seeking out the right
people in the right place

161
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,560
 to successfully carry out
the great climb.

162
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,560
Sometimes evening comes and I realize
that I did not speak a word all day.

163
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Strange, though it may seem, my day
was very enriching, in any case.

164
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,560
Will I become a weirdo?

165
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't care,
I have no secrets,

166
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,977
I just want to feel free.

167
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
My return home was quite chilling,

168
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,800
the bottle of champagne dad opened up,

169
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,720
the clinking of the glasses,
the toast for my homecoming.

170
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,040
It was all so bland and well
rehearsed that I asked myself

171
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:17,245
why I ever bothered to come
down from the mountains.

172
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,576
At times I find it hard to see
the sense of my job.

173
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,080
Yesterday I stumbled upon
my degree certificate

174
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,475
 I got a good mark.
But what is the point?

175
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,680
He graduated in law

176
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,760
and his father sent him to London

177
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,200
to get some good business experience.

178
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:45,360
But he had already decided
that a job like that was not for him.

179
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:50,935
I boldly settled that issue with
my father and he was taken aback.

180
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,840
He can not understand my refusing
a good job position.

181
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 They fail to understand
how you can have

182
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:02,425
any concrete and moral objectives
outside the business world.

183
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,640
My life is somewhere else !

184
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,040
Ettore liked to spend time here.

185
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,000
He was fond of the house,

186
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,200
he gladly stopped by to say hello
to my mother

187
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,280
When he broke his leg,

188
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,880
he spent the whole time here
on his crutches.

189
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,560
Many times he stayed over
to write his guides

190
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,240
instead of returning to Milan.

191
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,320
He came down from the mountains
 with his notes

192
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,400
and then over here
to sort them out

193
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,080
and prepare them for publication.

194
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,590
I need the quiet in Tregnago
with its blissful peace

195
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,520
to take a breather.

196
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,070
 Here is the rock I've always clung to
in my moments of despair.

197
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,264
Here lies my childhood,

198
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,480
the leaning post from where
I can start my ascent.

199
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,920
My dad and Ettore talked a lot about
philosophy and politics.

200
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,520
Hostility towards fascism in the
family was rampant from

201
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,720
when they had suppressed freedom
of thought and of the press.

202
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,640
But it was with the
establishment of racial laws

203
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,480
that he became
decidely anti-fascist.

204
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,320
He was very convinced in
his anti-fascist beliefs

205
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:13,200
even if they were only
ever expressed in words.

206
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,560
I always feel like I am just
passing through in Milan.

207
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:56,134
What weighs on me most is the
boring routine of city life.

208
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,080
Gossip, jealousy, anger,
politics and party reasoning

209
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,760
people who sell
themselves with no shame.

210
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,800
It's a set-up that
nauseates me, that sucks.

211
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,040
Now I also have all the bother
of accepting the medal that

212
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,000
if I don't, will offend all those
who have awarded it to me.

213
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,680
But what have they got
to do with my ascents?

214
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,480
They are mine
 and will always remain so,

215
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
untarnished by all the gold
in the world.

216
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,280
A true mountaineer
could never be fascist.

217
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,130
The world conflict has been going
on for 3 years

218
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:02,930
 Things are not going well
for Mussolini's Italy.

219
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,560
The allies' offensive has begun

220
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,160
and the top command
 needs more soldiers

221
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
 Ettore is forced
to leave his beloved mountains

222
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,040
and board a train to Aosta.

223
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:22,008
He was called as up as
Alpine Lieutenant at Aosta

224
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,120
in the role of instructor.

225
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,520
A task he carried out
with great diligence

226
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,240
because he liked the job.

227
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:39,981
Basically he taught the
young recruits to climb.

228
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,280
This is his military service record.

229
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
And we read that

230
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Castiglioni was recalled
up in May '43

231
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,560
 presenting himself
at the Aosta Mountaineering School

232
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,192
on June 11, 1943.

233
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Called up for his by now
well-famous, technical skills

234
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,040
But he was based
mostly in the mountains,

235
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,240
at the camps in Valpelline.

236
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,640
Precisely. He was an instructor

237
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
and so well away from any involvement
in the command.

238
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,300
I got such an immediate
and friendly welcome

239
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,726
and my name was held
 in such high esteem,

240
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,480
something I would certainly have never expected
in a military environment.

241
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,240
 It struck me as a corps made up
entirely of instructors.

242
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,200
Their sole concern was mountaineering.

243
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,560
At times, one forgot about the war.

244
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Then, with the arrival
of all the officers,

245
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,680
the atmosphere changed.

246
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
A look at the military's
 mountaineering school

247
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,454
during a theory lesson
given by the instructor officer

248
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,240
on wooden models
of the mountain faces,

249
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,572
 and done by the school's
better students.

250
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,960
Showing the various difficulties
to be faced during ascents

251
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,680
 and the techniques
for overcoming them.

252
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,720
The willing pupils on the course
are all eyes and ears,

253
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,960
in expectation of the test.
Tests that will lead to

254
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,160
an arduous and intrepidating
promotion to the sixth grade,

255
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:29,541
where the conquering of rock faces and
peaks like these will be vital.

256
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,880
This is service he only did
for a short time,

257
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:43,905
because on September 8th
 his work at the mountaineering school

258
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
 came to an end.

259
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,200
Then the army dissolves.
And from 11th June to 8th September?

260
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,680
Yes, Three months.

261
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,600
 The documents relating to that
period are unfortunately no longer available.

262
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:00,261
Did they ever exist?

263
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,840
On September 8th,
no documents are available

264
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,680
to account for
what had been going on.

265
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,560
One Monday morning,
I get up from my bed

266
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
and my assistant
enters the room to announce,

267
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,577
with the most naive of looks,
that Mussolini has done a bunker.

268
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,000
 I did not know whether
to believe the news or not!

269
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,640
Far too many times had our
hopes already been faded ...

270
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,532
Freedom, the word that everybody for twenty years
 had kept inside themselves,

271
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,320
 like a hidden treasure.

272
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,600
The impossibile task of battling
on in the unprecedented fight

273
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,200
against an overwhelming enemy power
has been accepted.

274
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,600
An armistice has been requested
from General Eisenhower.

275
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,720
That request was granted.

276
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,600
On the radio just confused news.

277
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
They are saying that
the Germans have entered Aosta

278
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,680
It is all generally fuzzy.
Utter chaos.

279
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
My pupils are wavering
about what to do,

280
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
and many are turning
to me for advice.

281
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:15,145
I am distressed,

282
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,360
I almost want to cry from the desire
to do something for these soldiers.

283
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,720
Castiglioni took his former soldiers
to the Berio,

284
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,600
a summer safe house that overlooked
the valley without being seen

285
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,040
 Ollomont was a thoroughfare,
a crossroads between Italy and Switzerland.

286
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
And for many who were escaping
war  and racial laws,

287
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,935
the door to salvation.

288
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,400
Ollomont was like a sea port,
given its border location

289
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,805
It was a point
of reference for the defectors

290
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,095
and who wanted to
go over into Switzerland.

291
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,280
The Berio was a very
well-known yet hidden place,

292
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,880
and the presence
of Castiglioni  and his soldiers

293
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,480
generated a certain sense of security

294
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,640
since the refugees
who were generally city people,

295
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,560
 and from far away,
were definitely in need of that.

296
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,480
In the evening we go to Berio
to explore our new home.

297
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,440
We sleep in the hay,
and early morning set to work.

298
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,119
We build a catchment for the water,
dig out an old stove,

299
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,280
several benches, and wooden boards
to  make into tables and chairs.

300
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,200
I have written up the charter
of this small independent republic;

301
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,880
all our belongings and work
will be shared in common

302
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,080
with no distinction of class or grade.

303
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,640
I am full of enthusiasm.

304
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,640
 I have a feeling that only among these friends
am I able to get satisfaction

305
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:27,720
  renouncing myself for the greater
good of the community and my companions.

306
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,920
In Luigi Einaudi's diary notes
about his exile, he talks of a captain

307
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,960
 who accompanied him and
his wife across the border.

308
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,640
Few hold any doubts about that
captain's identity as being

309
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:09,375
Ruggero Cominotti, at the
time little more than a boy.

310
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,720
There were two of us, myself
and another boy of my age.

311
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,320
One day we decided
to cross over into Switzerland

312
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,040
and head back up to
the Col de la Fenêtre,

313
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,760
unoccupied by the Germans.

314
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,600
En route we met a group
 of former military.

315
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,162
They had ripped up their uniforms

316
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,920
so as not to be sent
back to Germany as deserters.

317
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,560
One of them was obviously in charge

318
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,880
 but we were unaware
that it was the notorious Castiglioni.

319
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,880
They told us that

320
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,520
the gentleman on the mule
was an anti-fascist professor from Turin

321
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,560
who was being controlled
by the fascist secret police

322
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
and was bound for Switzerland

323
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,715
because the Germans
 were looking for him.

324
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,780
Later we discovered
  it was Luigi Einaudi.

325
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,120
I believe Castiglioni knew
 who it was, but he had chosen

326
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:32,105
not to tell any of his
group of ex-soldiers.

327
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,720
I have hardly any time
to write in the evening.

328
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,960
For nine days I have climbed up
to the border,

329
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,480
but even when I'm not there,
much still remains to be done.

330
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,945
 One thing is certain,
that being in contact with the refugees

331
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,600
you come face to face with what joy
that can bring.

332
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,000
Faces before filled with fear,

333
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,000
greet you at the border,
happy and carefree.

334
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,720
Giving people their freedom back,
helping them to flee

335
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,160
now gives me a reason to live!

336
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,800
 The identities of the refugees Castiglioni
helped reach the border

337
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,080
 still remain anonymous.

338
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,080
In the diary, I find only one
brief mention of an older couple with a boy,

339
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,560
the Bier family.
Yugoslav Jews fleeing racial laws

340
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,280
who arrived at Berio
after a long journey.

341
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,520
I find Milan Bier's story
in the archives of the Shoah Foundation.

342
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,640
We arrived by bus in Val d'Aosta,
on the border with Switzerland.

343
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,960
Wandering from one
valley to another,

344
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,760
till we found a way to get
into Switzerland.

345
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:19,280
 We were led
 by soldiers in civilian clothes,

346
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:26,840
 who had deserted the army
 following the German occupation of Italy.

347
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,680
But they were still there
 on the border.

348
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,360
And they escorted us through
very high mountains,

349
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:40,097
Col de la Fenêtre in Switzerland.
We left at 4 am,

350
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,480
and got to the border at noon.

351
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:51,720
At 7pm, I came to the first village
across the border.

352
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,840
One afternoon I go to the
border to meet with a corporal

353
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,000
and exchange Swiss cheese
and wine for bread and cigarettes

354
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,520
 Few worries, as I know him well.
When out of the blue,

355
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,514
there appears behind
him a border guard

356
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,424
 I have never seen before,
pointing a revolver and who forces me

357
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,666
to show the contents
of my pockets and a bag.

358
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:19,533
That is how this bizarre affair all began.
So I followed the guard,

359
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,640
totally oblivious to
the fact I was under arrest.

360
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,012
I am charged with smuggling,
 illegal entry, and espionage!

361
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,720
 It seems all so absurd.

362
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,351
During interrogations I am
asked about a suitcase.

363
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,480
And then I remember the Bier suitcase.

364
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:47,203
I had left it safe in Berio

365
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:50,719
and then brought it
to the border a few days later.

366
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,880
 But I swear
I never opened it.

367
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,440
When I was sent to Martigny
prison, I could not bear

368
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,960
the thought of even staying
there just two days.

369
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,289
Right from the start, I set
about thinking up escape plans,

370
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:22,906
 because the investigation
was never-ending.

371
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,320
And at the news of being
destined for a refugee camp,

372
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,040
for the first time,
I became alarmed.

373
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,840
Now the investigation is over,
only five days are left.

374
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,180
No longer is there any
need to plan an escape.

375
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,120
The wait is over. The doors
of the Martigny Prison flung open.

376
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,632
 And Castiglioni is escorted through
the streets of the city to the station,

377
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,680
refusing the offer to become
a political refugee and stay in the country.

378
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
 From now on,
he will be banned from Switzerland

379
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:59,240
for the rest of the war,

380
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:02,523
any failure to do so,
punishable with immediate arrest.

381
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
Milan after the latest bombings

382
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,400
 Every Italian on seeing the rubble
 will feel

383
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,720
a personal sense
 of destruction and loss.

384
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,920
Here is the La Scala theatre of Milan,
 a world temple of music.

385
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,440
The fury of war was pelted upon it,

386
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,280
deconsacrating more than a
century of glorious musical memories.

387
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,840
So I come back to my country,
a free man,  with little to celebrate.

388
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,640
Not a soul at the Berio.

389
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,560
Only a cold and empty house
to welcome me in Milan,

390
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,960
and smashed windows
after the summer bombings.

391
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:43,853
A city that is devastated.

392
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,040
The city must have been
under curfew those evenings.

393
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,720
And what Castiglioni was recording
in the diary took on a new edge.

394
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,560
The war had changed him.
And the wording had changed, too

395
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,000
This week I have worked
exclusively on spreading propoganda

396
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,880
 and helping those in danger.

397
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:08,625
Who knows when I can start
taking care of my own life again

398
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,480
 Right now, I feel a calling towards
more important tasks.

399
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,680
But what were those more
pressing tasks?

400
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:29,174
Who did he encounter
in those days of frantic activity?

401
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Perhaps members of the resistance

402
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:35,292
 from whom he was awaiting news,
a signal.

403
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,640
Perhaps he had been out
 looking for men

404
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,400
willing to be part of a group
 like Berio.

405
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,000
Many names, many faces,
but not one reliable witness.

406
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,040
Just hypotheses, suppositions.

407
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,000
Of the events that followed,
he had wanted to leave no trace.

408
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:01,921
In March 1944,
the diary stops.

409
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,280
The one and only consolation:
I managed to bring the piano

410
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,280
and alongside the music
the sun has come out.

411
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Lukewarm sun and a light breeze,

412
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:44,350
almost a mountain breeze
which fills up my lungs

413
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,360
 How I wish to return to the mountains

414
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:53,100
and find the vigour
to act once again, be my true self.

415
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,280
Everything that then follows
remains a mystery to us.

416
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,760
After the Berio period,
Ettore returned to Milan.

417
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,535
And then made an attempt
to enter Switzerland on a false passport.

418
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,520
 Exactly why we will never know.

419
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,760
On Saturday, March 11, 1944,

420
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,480
 Ettore Castiglioni
leaves a group of mountaineers

421
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,560
and crosses Valmalenco alone by ski.

422
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,720
He descends the Passo del Muretto,
that borders with Switzerland, and reaches Maloja.

423
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,440
In his jacket pocket lies the passport
of a Swiss citizen residing in Italy,

424
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,345
Oscar Brändli.

425
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,880
I used to be a tourist and
often went to the mountains.

426
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:34,498
For the summer holidays
we went to Chiareggio.

427
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,880
"Is that where you met Castiglioni?"

428
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,480
Yes,
 in the mountain refuge named Porro.

429
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:50,320
We started to talk and he said he had
been to Switzerland on a mission.

430
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,760
But had been captured
by the police.

431
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,840
He was released but told
he could not return.

432
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,280
This time he was definitely more cautious.

433
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:16,160
He said to me, we look quite similar,
 would you lend me your passport?

434
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,920
If they catch me,
I'll say I stole it.

435
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,960
 There was a mutual
respect between us,

436
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,160
without needing to ask too much.

437
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,000
The less you knew, the better.

438
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,040
Other comrades said he had to go
forthe CLN (National Liberation Committee).

439
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,640
One thing was clear,
someone who wants to enter

440
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,360
and then leave Switzerland
can but only be on a mission.

441
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,440
And it was in Switzerland
he was betrayed.

442
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,040
He met a person
who called him by his real name

443
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,040
and that aroused suspicion.
the police were called

444
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:10,185
and he was arrested.

445
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,280
In spite of having a long tradition
for asylum seekers dating back to 1848,

446
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,600
 with the birth of the modern Federal State,

447
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,440
Switzerland becomes
a country of transit,

448
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,520
and especially during
the years of fascism and nazism

449
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
 many people were passing
through Switzerland,

450
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,920
where it is clear
they were not to remain

451
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,400
but continue their journey
onto other countries.

452
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:45,339
We are at the end of the winter of
1944 and the war is reaching its end.

453
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,920
Castiglioni arrives on a fake passport
and as a clandestine.

454
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,960
What had he to lose?

455
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,840
Since the beginning of the war,

456
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:56,095
Switzerland has introduced
a visa requirement for everyone.

457
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,160
 So entry into Switzerland without one,
is illegal.

458
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,440
 All refugees who reach
Switzerland during the war are illegals,

459
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,200
and would most certainly
be sent to a refugee camp.

460
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:10,207
And the police document?

461
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,400
There are various reports.

462
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:15,802
A very interesting document
is this one here,

463
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:19,396
 sent by the border guard to the army.

464
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,720
It starts by describing Castiglioni's arrest.

465
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,677
The corporal realized immediately
that the photo did not correspond

466
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
to the person in front of him.

467
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Another document says,
"We talked in German

468
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,935
and I figured immediately
that it was an Italian refugee."

469
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,800
Castiglioni undergoes
questioning and is soon identified.

470
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,760
He is locked up in a room
at Hotel Longhin in Maloja

471
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,920
because it is evening and the last bus
going to St. Moritz has already left.

472
00:48:52,945 --> 00:48:55,985
They take away his clothes,
 shoes and backpack.

473
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,130
And they check on him regularly
to see what he is up to

474
00:48:58,155 --> 00:48:59,631
and if he is still in the room.

475
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,880
Ah, thank you. Are these the photos?

476
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,510
Yes

477
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,371
Interesting

478
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,960
 This is exactly the building
 at that time.

479
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:31,207
 Did you know about
Castiglioni's story ?

480
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,000
Yes. There has always been
someone around asking for information.

481
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,200
 Always been a lot of interest.

482
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,000
Do you know where Castiglioni was held?

483
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,706
Yes. Right here. This is the balcony.

484
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:46,831
This one here?

485
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,120
Yes

486
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,000
My dad was called Edmondo Gianotti
but everyone called him Mondin

487
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,240
 And he did many days
of military service during the war.

488
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,280
He was stationed
in Maloja at Hotel Longhin.

489
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,360
And one night they brought
in this young Italian man, Castiglioni.

490
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,120
 Definitely, he lived to regret it
and was troubled by it.

491
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,720
Always asking himself,
"Did I do the right thing

492
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,640
stripping this poor man
of his clothes?"

493
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,680
My father imagined
he wanted to run away

494
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,420
 because he kept telling him
 he had to deliver a message.

495
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,840
He had probably pleaded with my dad
to let him go, but he didn't.

496
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,280
There is this list of names, perhaps
one of the most interesting documents.

497
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:15,160
When the police stop Castiglioni
they uncover this document in his backpack,

498
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,400
and ask for explanations.
And he replies, "They are people

499
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,560
I wanted to send greetings to."

500
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:28,655
Seeing the English Consulate in Geneva
is mentioned,

501
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:36,480
it might be assumed
that Castigliani was on a mission

502
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,560
to establish contacts with
the allies in Switzerland.

503
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,320
To take messages.

504
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,480
If he was on mission
for the National Liberation Committee

505
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,480
it was a secret mission!

506
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,480
So this mission
would not be documented.

507
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,040
When he decides
to escape his prison-room,

508
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,240
he had to have been aware
of the risks he was taking!

509
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,160
Especially half-naked!

510
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,680
It is true that he overestimated
his physical forces.

511
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,000
Even if he did possess
remarkable strength,

512
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:54,140
and likewise remarkable experience.

513
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,960
But attempting such a feat was
little short of committing suicide.

514
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,640
Reading the diary of Castiglioni
I have the impression that

515
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,560
in a moment of great historical
change in Italy,

516
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:23,820
Castiglioni wanted to be part
of a larger movement in the country's rebirth.

517
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,960
That he was almost looking for a mission.

518
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,360
 For him, being stopped
and locked up in Switzerland

519
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:34,085
meant the end
of every imaginable goal.

520
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:41,360
And his internment would
prevent other missions from crossing the border.

521
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:52,000
The anti-fascist fighter in him seems

522
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:59,840
to be have emerged from his growing interest

523
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,960
in being actively involved in society,

524
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,200
even if not part of his nature.

525
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:16,720
It came with experience,
the contacts he made and historical events.

526
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:23,160
Something that came to maturity
only in the last phase of his life.

527
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,480
Letters and official documents
tell the facts,

528
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,000
what took place is clear.

529
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:33,699
But the reasons?

530
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,040
What are the underlying reasons
for this strange adventure?

531
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,480
 I'm looking for answers
and I find only questions.

532
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,000
The end feels like a beginning.

533
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,157
And in the middle,
a man looking in the mirror

534
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,840
and filling page after page
in a diary.

535
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,040
On June 12, 1944, Vitale Bramani
wrote to his friends,

536
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:04,068
“Finally with the melting of snow last
Sunday, the deputy Prefect of Sondrio

537
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,480
who was aware of
Castiglioni's disappearance,

538
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,320
recovered the body one hundred
meters below the Forno Pass,

539
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,760
in Italian territory.
Findings made by the autopsy,

540
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,240
attributed the cause of death
to frostbite.

541
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,240
His death has deeply shaken
and grieved many.

542
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,640
The mountain climbing have lost
one of their most valued members

543
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,480
we have lost
a beloved friend”.

544
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,520
For me, I learned so much from
his integrity and discipline.

545
01:00:37,545 --> 01:00:45,776
A very concrete example of creating
your own role in society.

546
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,809
Castiglioni died exactly as
he had foreseen and written about,

547
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,400
 many years before.
Simply a coincidence?

548
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,800
The white mass recollects
itself and I am thrown to the ground

549
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,120
a nothingness.

550
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,520
Nature, once this little drama
has been played out,

551
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,640
reassumes its uncontested force.

552
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,520
Stripped by now of my human condition.

553
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,720
Nothing left of what
I once have been.

554
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:46,792
Only now,
in a state of total annihilation,

555
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,800
left to lie still amid
this vast white domain,

556
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,800
you realize only then,
that all of this was

557
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:57,948
nothing but an illusion.
